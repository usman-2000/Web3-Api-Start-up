Web3 Api Startup

Building my web3 API start-up, in which i can provide users to upload the NFT to IPFS, and allow them to make API requests to fetch all the IPFS blockchain smart contract data.
I will also add the functionality about other data structures like docs, text and other form of data. User can upload data and get api to use that on other projects. They can also download the actual data.
